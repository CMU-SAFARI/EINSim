TODO - list of outstanding tasks for EINSim:

Improvements:
+ Better output format
	+ Extensible to arbitrary configurations and observables
	+ More compact representation of ^ information
+ Better stress tests for all corner cases of the ECC implementations
+ General performance optimization
	+ Perhaps a more efficient representation than Eigen data types?

New features:
+ Wider range of ECC schemes (e.g., LDPC, non-binary)
+ Different encoding/decoding algorithms (e.g., soft decoding)
